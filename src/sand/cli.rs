SHORTER COMMAND ALIASES
    You can use any prefix of a subcommand, as long as it is unambiguous. For
    example:
        `sand s 10m` is equivalent to `sand start 10m`.
        `sand l` is equivalent to `sand list`.
        `sand p 1` is equivalent to `sand pause 1`.

CUSTOM SOUNDS
    To use a custom timer sound, place an audio file at

        $XDG_DATA_HOME/sand-timer/timer_sound.{mp3,wav,flac,aac,m4a}.

    XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to ~/.local/share/"
